Dependencies
Some of the utility functions make use of the following Python libraries:

hashlib: For hashing (SHA-256, RIPEMD-160).
ecdsa: For elliptic curve cryptography (used in Bitcoin).
base58: For Base58 encoding/decoding (used in WIF and Bitcoin addresses).

Make sure you have these installed:
`pip install ecdsa base58`

This utils.py file provides a set of helper functions that will be useful in various parts of your Bitcoin client. These functions handle key aspects of Bitcoin's cryptography and data encoding.
